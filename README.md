# PitchPerfect
An app that records a message and plays the audio back through user-selected filters.

## Purpose:
I made an iPhone app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback. â€‹

## How to use:
Open using Xcode on mac.
